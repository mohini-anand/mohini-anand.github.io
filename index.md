<p> 
  I’m a PhD student in Computer Science at Purdue University, where I work on representation learning for complex, structured data, primarily in medical imaging. I’m particularly interested in problems where meaningful structure exists but is not directly observable, evaluation metrics are weak or ambiguous, and modeling assumptions matter as much as algorithmic choice. 
</p>

<p> 
  Much of my work focuses on cardiac diffusion MRI, where hundreds of thousands of fiber trajectories must be analyzed without labels or ground truth. These settings have shaped how I think about learning representations, favoring geometric structure, domain-informed features, and interpretability over purely black-box performance. 
</p>

<p> 
  Before starting my PhD, I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from NYU Tandon. I enjoy working across the stack, from data preprocessing and model design to interpretation and visualization. Working with complex medical imaging data has made me comfortable systematically exploring and discarding modeling approaches before converging on representations that reveal meaningful structure in the data.
